## How to Deploy a New OS Image

### Concept

When a virtual machine is created, some actions need to be done within the guest like resizing of the filesystem, creation of users,... To accomplish this, [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is used. For most Linux distributions OS cloud images with cloud-init preinstalled are readily available for download. The rest of this page assumes you have such an OS image with cloud-init available. There is a guide on [how to create a windows base image with cloudinit](Creating_new_Windwos_Image.md).


### Clone the repository of your environment

From a well prepared computer, as documented [here](../Connect/preparing_before_connecting.md), your first step will be to clone the repository of your environment from GitHub:

```
git clone git@github.com:gig-projects/$name-of-your-env-repository$
```

### Create a new image directory and the AYS service recipe for your new image

For each service you want to add to your environment you need to create a new subdirectory under `$name-of-your-env-repository$/servicetemplates`, so also for adding a new image you need to create a subdirectory there:

```
cd $name-of-your-env-repository$/servicetemplates
```

Let's create an subdirectory for the image available from https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/xenial/current/xenial-server-cloudimg-amd64-uefi1.img:

```
mkdir image_xenial-server
```

Each directory contains 3 files:

- **service.hrd** contains the all required information about ftp server that holds your image

  - **url**: address of your FTP server from where the image is available, e.g. `ftp://pub:pub1234@ftp.aydo.com`
  - **source**: exact location on the FTP server from where the image can be downloaded, e.g. `/images/image_windows2012`
  - **checkmd5**: whether the MD5 checksum needs to be checked, typically 'true'
  - **dest**: directory where the image needs to be downloaded, e.g. `/opt/jumpscale7/var/tmp/templates/image_windows2012.qcow2`

- **actions.py** defines the configure method that will be called to register the image once it got downloaded successfully

  - **name** sets the image name, e.g. 'image_windows2012'
  - **imagename** sets the disk image name as physically saved, e.g. 'image_windows2012.qcow2'
  - **registerImage(serviceObj, name, imagename, category, minimum-image-size)** the actual registration method, where you have two additional parameters:
    - **category** specifies under which category the image will be available to the end user, typically 'Linux' or 'Windows'
    - **minimum-image-size** sets the minimum image size, in case of a windows image you have to set it to at least 20, otherwise 10 is fine for linux images

- **instance.hrd** (leave it empty)

We actually only need to create 2 files, representing the AYS service recipe for this image:
- service.hrd
- actions.py

Starting with **service.hrd**:

```
vi service.hrd
```

Provide following service description:

```
platform.supported             = 'generic'

web.export.1                   =
    checkmd5:'false',
    dest:'/opt/jumpscale7/var/tmp/templates/xenial-server-cloudimg-amd64-uefi1.qcow2',
    source:'/xenial/current/xenial-server-cloudimg-amd64-uefi1.img',
    url:'https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com',
```

Save and close the new file by first pressing **esc**, typing **:wq** and hitting **enter**.

And now let's create the **actions.py** file:

```
vi actions.py
```

We only need to implement the **configure()** method:

```
from JumpScale import j

ActionsBase=j.atyourservice.getActionsBaseClass()

class Actions(ActionsBase):
    def configure(self, serviceObj):
        from CloudscalerLibcloud.imageutil import registerImage
        name = 'Xenial Server 16.04 amd64'
        imagename = 'xenial-server-cloudimg-amd64-uefi1.qcow2'
        registerImage(serviceObj, name, imagename, 'Linux', 10)
```

### Save, commit and push your changes to the repo

Commit and push the newly created subdirectory and files to GitHub:

```
cd $name-of-your-env-repository$
git config --global push.default simple
git add servicetemplates/image_xenial-server
git commit -m "new image"
git push
```

### Install the image

Connect to **ovc_git** as documented [here](../Connect/connect.md).

Update the repository:

```
cd /opt/code/github/gig-projects/$name-of-your-env-repository$
git pull
```

Make the updated **servicetemplates** directory current:

```
cd /opt/code/github/gig-projects/$name-of-your-env-repository$/servicetemplates
```

And finally install the image, make sure to specify the name of one/any of the physical nodes (last option argument):

```
ays install -n image_xenial-server --targetname $name-of-a-storage-node-in-your-env$

```
Example $name-of-a-storage-node-in-your-env$ : stor-01.be-g8-4 

In case you're updating an already previously installed image, use the -r option:

```
ays install -r -n image_xenial-server --targetname $name-of-a-node-in-your-env$
```


### Set image availability

In the **Cloud Broker Portal** go to the **Image Details** page for your newly added image and select **Image Availability** from the **Actions** menu:

Confirm on which nodes you want to make this image available:
